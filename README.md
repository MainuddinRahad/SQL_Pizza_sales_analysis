The dataset includes the following key attributes:

- **Pizza Categories:** Classic, Supreme, Veggie, and Chicken.

- **Pizza Types:** Detailed breakdown of specific pizzas within each category.

- **Order Details:** Quantities and times of orders (from 9:00 AM to 11:00 PM).

- **Revenue Data:** Revenue generated by each pizza type and category.

# Objectives

- Analyze pizza sales distribution by category and type.

- Identify top revenue-generating pizzas.

- Examine sales patterns across different times of the day.

- Calculate revenue and order contribution percentages for categories and pizzas.

- Provide actionable insights for optimizing pizza offerings.

# Tool and Technology I Used

- **SQL:** The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insights.

- **PostgreSQL:** The chosen database management system, ideal for handling the job posting data.

- **Visual Studio Code:** My go-to for database management and executing SQL queries.

- **Git & GitHub:** Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.

- **Power BI:** I can use these to create a greate visual to my SQL query result.
    

# The Analysis 

The analysis I have done using SQL queries.Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of sales analysis for this resturant. Hereâ€™s how I approached each question.

### 1. Retrieve the total number of orders placed.

```sql
SELECT
    count(order_id) AS Total_order_placed
FROM
    orders
```

This result indicates that a total of 21,350 pizzas were ordered across all entries in the year of 2015.

### 2. Calculate the total revenue generated from pizza sales.

Break down the total revenue by quarters (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) and provide the overall yearly revenue as well.

```sql
SELECT
   CASE
        WHEN EXTRACT(quarter FROM date) = 1 THEN 'Q1'
        WHEN EXTRACT(quarter FROM date) = 2 THEN 'Q2'
        WHEN EXTRACT(quarter FROM date) = 3 THEN 'Q3'
        WHEN EXTRACT(quarter FROM date) = 4 THEN 'Q4'
   END AS quarterly_revenue,
   Cast(sum(quantity*price) as decimal(10,2)) AS Total_revenue
FROM
    order_details
    LEFT JOIN pizzas
    ON order_details.pizza_id = pizzas.pizza_id
    LEFT JOIN orders
    ON order_details.order_id = orders.order_id
GROUP BY quarterly_revenue
ORDER BY quarterly_revenue ASC
```
### Here's the breakdown Total Revenue Quarterly..

- Total Annual Revenue: **$817,860.05**

- Revenues in Q1, Q2, and Q3 are relatively stable, ranging
   from **$205,016.20** to **$208,369.75.**

- Q4 has the lowest revenue at **$199,124.10**, about 3-4% lower than the other quarters.

I can create this line chart by using Power BI.

### 3. Identify the ( TOP - 10 ) highest-priced pizza.

```sql
SELECT
    name AS pizza_name,
    price,
    count(order_details.pizza_id) AS pizza_order
FROM
    pizza_types
    LEFT JOIN pizzas
    ON pizza_types.pizza_type_id = pizzas.pizza_type_id
    LEFT JOIN order_details
    ON pizzas.pizza_id = order_details.pizza_id
GROUP BY pizza_name , price
ORDER BY price  DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
### Here's the breakdown of TOP - 10 highest price pizza.

- **The Greek Pizza"** priced at **$35.95** has the lowest number of
   **orders (28)**, suggesting it might be too expensive.

- The lower-priced variant of **"The Greek Pizza"** at **$25.50** has 
   significantly more **orders (544)**, showing that demand improves when the price is reduced.

- Most pizzas priced at **$20.75** dominate in order volume: 

    1. **"The Spicy Italian Pizza": 1,088** orders (highest overall).

    2. **"The California Chicken Pizza": 895** orders.

    3. **"The Italian Supreme Pizza":** 735 orders.

- These results indicate that **$20.75** is a sweet spot for pricing, balancing affordability with customer demand.
